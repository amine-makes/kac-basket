# KAC Basketball — Vite + React + TypeScript Store

Small demo e-commerce storefront built with Vite, React, TypeScript and Tailwind.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes
- If you see an npm audit warning about `esbuild` / `vite`, the automatic fix may require upgrading Vite to a newer major version which can include breaking changes. Review the audit output before running `npm audit fix --force`.
- The project uses an `@` path alias pointing to `src/` in `vite.config.ts`.

Deployment

- You can deploy the `dist/` output to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, S3 + CloudFront, etc.).
- For quick preview run `npm run preview` after `npm run build`.

Contributing

Open a PR and CI will run the build.
